<h1>Weather App</h1>

<p>I made this application from scratch using the official documentation, online videos and some advice from Claude AI</p>
<p>This application is meant for learning and diving into a new environment like Android Studio! I've never programmed in Kotlin and I was also curious about trying jetpack compose</p>
<p>I know that the app is far from finished, in fact I have many features I want to implement in the future, but I think it can be considered at least presentable</p>


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p>Weather Informations in a certain place</p></li>
  <li><p>City Research</p></li>
  <li><p>Caching for previous data</p></li>
  <li><p>List of all the City the user's searched</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Future Updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Better UI in the main page and in city Research's page</li>
  <li>Storing user's past research even when the app is closed</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mentions</h2>
<h3>All the icons I used are available on <a href= "https://lottiefiles.com/">LottieFiles</a></h3>
<h3>Weather data provided by <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap API</a>(free version)</h3>
